## 🤖 Mini Project Highlight

### 🐍 Python automations for DevSecOps tasks, including IP allow list management.
IP Allow List Automation Script

To manage access control within my organization, I developed a Python script that automates maintenance of an `allow_list.txt` file.

🔧 **Features:**  
- Reads from both the allow list and a remove list  
- Automatically removes outdated IPs  
- Outputs an updated allow list  
- Can be scheduled as a daily cron job  

📁 **Project Location:**  
`/projects/ip-allowlist-cleaner/`
